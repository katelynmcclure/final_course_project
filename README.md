This is the GitHub Repo for Katelyn McClure and Kynan Desouza-Chen's STAT/COMP 212 final project: Macalester Women's Volleyball Statistical Analysis. We collected data from the [Macalester College Athletics](https://athletics.macalester.edu/sports/2008/1/29/VB_0129081140.aspx) website.

Our final artifact is a Shiny app that includes an interactive game win/loss predictor based on game results from the 2021-2024 seasons as well as an analysis of the Macaclester Senior class of 2025 players over their four years playing for the team. Our code to create the Shiny app is located within the "code" folder of the Repo. [Here is the link to the Macalester Volleyball Shiny App]() (ADD THE LINK ONCE WE HAVE IT).

The "results" folder contains our midway check-in report, Milestone 3. In this report, we presented the progress of our semester-long process. The "planning" folder contains our initial planning document created at the beginning of the semester.
