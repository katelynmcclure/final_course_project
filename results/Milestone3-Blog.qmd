Write a short blog post (no more than 1000 words) about your results so far. Create a Milestone3-Blog.qmd file in your results folder within project repository on Github and render to generate an HTML file for this post. In this post, you should:
Motivate the importance of the topic
Lead the reader through the rationale for the narrowing/focusing of the scope via the main 2-3 broad questions
Tie results (plots and modeling output) to the broad questions and explain how all results fit together
End with main takeaways, limitations with regard to the data context and ethical considerations, and future directions
